SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Hiring an SEO professional has the potential to rapidly improve your search engine rankings and drive organic traffic to your sites. Most of all, it can save you time. If you hire bad experts, they can give you bad advice. People who recommend bad practices may cause damage to your website and reputation. When hiring an SEO professional, keep in mind the following general recommendations.

## 1. Interview your potential SEO consultant. 

Content marketing is not only about SEO. An excellent expert in this field will focus on search engine rankings, of course, but at the same time will also work on how to improve your online presence to help your business. 

Good SEO experts usually ask the following throughout the interview: 
* What is unique about business, content, or service? What makes it valuable to customers? 
* Who are your regular customers? 
* How are they currently finding you? 
* What is your method for making money, and how would search help you do better?
* What other channels do you use? 
* Do you run offline ads? 
* Do you run ad campaigns on social media? Or how do you use social media?
* Who are your competitors? 
* How are your competitors perform online and offline? 

If the expert does not seem interested in understanding your business, please consider finding another expert. Without understanding the customer's business goals, it isn't easy to properly optimize their website content and other existing marketing efforts. 

Be aware of providing unrealistic guarantees, such as the "professional" who makes you number one in Google overnight. No one can promise this, and usually, those who do, violate Google Webmaster Guidelines. For example, creating unnatural links and portals. Suppose there is a severe violation. It may cause your page or website to be permanently deleted from Google's search database. 

## 2. Check their references. 

You want to check with past clients and confirm that SEO experts can deliver on their promise. 
Make sure that the results they delivered in past projects are permanent, not temporary. A good professional will help SEO become part of your general day-to-day business operations. They focus on long-term planning and help your brand grow over time, not overnight. 

## 3. Request a Technical and Search Review and Report.

If you trust your SEO candidate, provide them with a restricted or incomplete view of your content. Or maybe even the right to write Google Search Console data or Analytics data.

Before they modify any content on your site, ask them to conduct a 'Technical and Search Review' to provide you with a prioritized list of improvements that should be made for SEO. After reviewing your site, SEO experts should prioritize issues and make suggestions for improvement. These recommendations should be based on your website's data, work well with your online image, and avoid possible violations or improper practices of Google Webmaster Guidelines.

Ideally, it would be best to look for a focus on technology and strategy. This is proven to work much better than suggestions on search engines. The audit should also point out an estimate for the overall investment and the expected positive impact on the business. After the interview, the reference check, and technical review, you should be ready to evaluate potential SEO experts. 

## Conclusion

A good SEO professional will prioritize using the least resources. They will provide content and process proposals to improve your business. They will also tell you that it may take more time initially, but it will promote growth improvement in the long run.

Your chosen experts should feel like they can work and experiment with you. It would be best if you learned from them, and they should help you and your business plan the way for people. 
After hiring them, first work with them to agree on goals, targets, and how you will track the results in advance. This way, you can know what you will get out of it.
